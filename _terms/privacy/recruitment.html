<h2 id="what-we-collect-where-we-store-it-and-how-long-we-keep-it">What we collect, where we store it, and how long we keep it</h2>

<p>When you apply for a job at Basecamp (the company), we may store your data in two places. 1) When you apply, your information is collected via an application form in <a href="https://www.workable.com/">Workable</a>, our applicant tracking system. 2) If you progress to later selection stages, your information is colocated in Basecamp (the application). Candidate data we collect and process in Workable and Basecamp are used for selection purposes only. Access to your personal information is limited to Basecamp employees who participate in the selection process.</p>

<p>We collect and store these data because we have a legitimate interest: we are trying to hire for a position and we need information from any candidate who applies for the role. If you apply for a job at Basecamp, we ask for your explicit consent so that we can accept your application information, transfer it to the US, and review your candidacy.</p>

<p>For more information about your rights to your data, please view our general <a href="../index.md">privacy policy</a>; all the rights outlined there also apply to your data as a candidate.</p>

<p>We keep records in Workable for all applicants, and Workable records consist of:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Your job application materials (full name, e-mail address, your answers to any short answer questions required in the application, your cover letter, your CV/resume);</li>
  <li>Internal assessment notes about your application;</li>
  <li>Emails with you concerning the selection process.</li>
</ul>

<p>We keep records in Basecamp for some applicants, only those who progress to later selection rounds, and Basecamp records consist of:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Your job application materials (full name, e-mail address, your answers to any short answer questions required in the application, your cover letter, your CV/resume);</li>
  <li>Internal assessment notes about your application and interviews;</li>
  <li>Reference contact information and notes on the results of reference checks.</li>
</ul>

<p>For most candidates, we’ll store your data in Workable and in Basecamp until we successfully fill the open position. We’ll keep your personal data for <em>up to two years</em> if you advance to a take-home exercise or interview stage of our hiring process. We do this to maintain a pool of recent, qualified applicants, should the position re-open or should we decide to hire for another similar role. You can ask us to access, correct, update, or delete your data at any time by emailing Andrea LaRowe, <a href="mailto:andrea@basecamp.com">andrea@basecamp.com</a>.</p>

<p>If you submit an unsolicited job application through a channel other than Workable, you’ll receive direction to re-submit your application through Workable. Any personal information you’ve included, like a resume, will be immediately deleted.</p>

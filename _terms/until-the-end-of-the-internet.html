<p>Internet software and services disappear all the time because of whimsy (“changing priorities”), acquisition, financial failure, or worse. It’s become a risky venture to place your trust and data in services that could disappear at any moment, for any reason, and with no guarantee that your data will be safe, preserved, or even portable.</p>

<p>We want more for our customers.</p>

<p>When they launched, each of our products was our finest work. They were the result of countless hours laboring to build software that is simple, clear, easy-to-use, and honest. They remind us where we’ve been, how we got here, and point to where we’re going. We’re proud of these products and honored by all the customers who have supported us over the years, who made our tools partners in their success, and who continue to rely on them every day.</p>

<h2 id="its-a-promise-to-our-customers">It’s a promise to our customers</h2>

<p>We’re dedicated to supporting our products forever (or until the last customer turns off the lights). We stand against the tide of ephemeral software and services that are frustratingly common on the Internet. Basecamp is built to last. Supporting our legacy products and customers who love them isn’t free or easy but it’s the right thing to do. We’ll be here until the end of the Internet.</p>

<p>Here’s what that means:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The day you become a customer of any of our products, you can trust that Basecamp will be around. In the event that the Basecamp product you’re using enters a legacy phase you’ll be able to keep using it indefinitely, assuming you continue to abide by our <a href="../terms/index.md">terms of service</a> and keep your subscription active. We work hard to keep supporting existing features unless it becomes technically impossible to do so for reasons out of our control (e.g. changes to 3rd party integrations that makes a feature incompatible or browser upgrades that leave a feature behind).</li>
  <li>Your data is safe. Regardless of status, all of our products receive the same rigorous care when it comes to <a href="../security/index.md">security</a> and <a href="../privacy/index.md">privacy</a>. While we may not add new features to legacy products we’ll continue to apply the latest security updates; maintain the infrastructure that keeps them safe, fast and secure; and continue to offer <a href="support@trade-portal.co.uk">customer support</a>.</li>
  <li>This is our life’s work — we’re in this for the long haul. In the unforeseen and unanticipated event that the company or one of our products is acquired by another company or spun-off into a separate company, we’ll do everything in our power to make sure the product and this promise live on.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="changes-and-questions">Changes and questions</h2>
